# TwigaDAO
Twiga DAO based in Nairobi National Park is a community-driven initiative aimed at protecting the park's biodiversity and promoting sustainable conservation practices. 
The DAO brings together local communities, conservationists, government agencies, and global environmental activists to leverage blockchain technology for transparent decision-making, resource allocation, and governance. Through tokenized incentives, voting mechanisms, and decentralized participation, this DAO facilitates projects that directly benefit the park's wildlife, flora, and surrounding ecosystems.

# Benefits:

Community Empowerment: Local stakeholders, including park rangers, residents, and NGOs, have an active role in the decision-making process, ensuring that conservation efforts align with the needs of the community.
Sustainable Funding: The DAO can issue tokenized funds, allowing for donations, grants, and investment from global conservation entities, businesses, and individuals interested in supporting the park’s preservation.
Data-Driven Decisions: Blockchain integration provides secure, immutable tracking of conservation activities, allowing for better planning, data analysis, and decision-making based on real-time information.
Decentralized Governance: With token-based voting, members of the DAO can propose and vote on policies related to the park, ensuring that all voices are heard in the governance of the park’s resources.
